## Design Proposal

*   **Color Palette:**
    *   Primary: `#4A90E2` (a nice shade of blue)
    *   Secondary: `#F5F7FA` (a light gray for the background)
    *   Accent: `#50E3C2` (a vibrant green for buttons and highlights)
    *   Text: `#333333` (a dark gray for readability)
*   **Typography:**
    *   Font: `Montserrat` from Google Fonts. It's a clean and modern sans-serif font that works well for both headings and body text.
    *   Headings: `font-weight: 700`
    *   Body: `font-weight: 400`
*   **Layout:**
    *   I'll add more padding and margins to create a more spacious layout.
    *   I'll use a single-column layout for the main content to improve focus and readability.
*   **UI Elements:**
    *   Buttons: I'll use rounded corners and a subtle shadow to make them look more modern.
    *   Forms: I'll use custom-styled radio buttons and checkboxes to match the new design.
    *   Progress Bar: I'll style the progress bar to be more prominent and visually appealing.
*   **Logo:**
    *   I'll create a simple and modern logo using a combination of a geometric shape and the company name.
